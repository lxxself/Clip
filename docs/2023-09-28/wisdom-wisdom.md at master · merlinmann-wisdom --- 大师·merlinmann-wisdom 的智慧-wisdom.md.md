## [Voi ch'entrate…](#voi-chentrate)

Brief introductory remarks regarding the Project:  
关于该项目的简要介绍：

* The ideas on offer here are based on my own experiences and sensibilities. They are mostly things that, above all, I have needed to learn.  
这里提供的想法是基于我自己的经验和感受。最重要的是，它们大多是我需要学习的东西。
* As it happens, most of the ideas have been painful to learn and even more difficult to practice.  
事实上，大多数想法学起来都很痛苦，实践起来更是困难。
* Some of the ideas are, admittedly, just my opinion.  
诚然，有些想法只是我的意见。
* Many of the ideas will seem to contradict one other. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean one of them has to be wrong.  
许多想法似乎相互矛盾。不幸的是，这并不意味着其中之一一定是错误的。
* None of the ideas will be true for every person or for all times. In the event that you ever successfully identify ideas that are true for every person and for all times, you may wish to start a religion.  
这些想法并不适用于每个人或所有时代。如果你成功地找到了对每个人和所有时代都适用的想法，你可能会想创立一种宗教。
* Also, none of the ideas is offered with the intention of being unkind, exclusionary, hurtful, or existentially ugly. If any comes across that away, I sincerely apologize in advance.  
此外，这些想法的提出都不是出于不友善、排他性、伤害性或存在丑陋的意图。如果有人遇到这种情况，我提前真诚地道歉。
* Related: for any idea that strikes you as irrelevant or dumb or wrong or antithetical to your own experiences and sensibilities, please consider that it may not be, as we say, _for_ you. The reader is encouraged to ignore or reject any ideas that they find undesirable.  
相关：对于任何让您觉得无关、愚蠢、错误或与您自己的经历和感受相反的想法，请考虑到它可能不适合您。鼓励读者忽略或拒绝他们认为不受欢迎的任何想法。
* But, do bear in mind that often it's the idea that finds _you_ undesirable. The better ideas usually have pretty high standards.  
但是，请记住，往往正是这种想法让你不受欢迎。更好的想法通常具有相当高的标准。
* These are ideas that I have believed to be true for myself at the time of composition. They are not immutable truths about The Universe, and I am open to changing my mind about any of them at any time.  
在创作时，我相信这些想法对我自己来说是正确的。它们并不是关于宇宙的一成不变的真理，我愿意随时改变我对其中任何一个的看法。
* Ideas appended with a “thanks" are wisdoms that I gratefully learned from that credited person—often many years ago. They are not “submissions.” Because, alas, I am not _Reader’s Digest_.  
带有“感谢”字样的想法是我感激地从那位值得赞扬的人那里学到的智慧——通常是很多年前。它们不是“提交”。因为，唉，我不是《读者文摘》。
* If you believe that it is possible to grow without change, you are probably neither growing nor changing.  
==如果你相信不改变就能成长，那么你可能既没有成长，也没有改变。==
* Bulleted lists are a useful way to collect items that are either unrelated or may not benefit from being puffed into actual fancy prose.  
项目符号列表是一种有用的方法，可以收集那些不相关或可能无法从实际的花哨散文中受益的项目。
* None of the ideas should be interpreted as actual advice of any kind or for any purpose, and, thus, the Project is provided _as-is_.  
任何想法都不应被解释为任何种类或任何目的的实际建议，因此，该项目按原样提供。
* You should _not_ rely upon this Project or its constituent ideas for _any purpose_ without seeking legal, medical, emotional, spiritual, and/or directed career counseling.  
在未寻求法律、医疗、情感、精神和/或定向职业咨询的情况下，您不应出于任何目的依赖本项目或其组成思想。
* No glass containers, coolers, or inflammable materials will be permitted. No motorcycles after 3pm.  
不允许使用玻璃容器、冷却器或易燃材料。下午3点以后禁止骑摩托车。
* The Project is never done.  
该项目从未完成。

## [The Wisdom So Far 迄今为止的智慧](#the-wisdom-so-far)

* Sometimes, an email is just a way to say, “I love you.”  
有时，电子邮件只是表达“我爱你”的一种方式。
* People think about you much less than you either hope or fear.  
人们对你的看法比你希望或担心的要少得多。
* It’s often easier not to be terrible.  
不变得可怕往往更容易。
* Whenever you’re not sure what to say, either say nothing, or ask a question.  
当你不确定该说什么时，要么什么也不说，要么问一个问题。
* Be sparing in how often you tell someone their negative feelings are wrong; it rarely helps a sad person to be told that they are also a liar.  
避免告诉别人他们的负面情绪是错误的；如果一个悲伤的人被告知自己也是个骗子，这对他没有什么帮助。
* Related: feelings are _real_. (Thanks, Mike S.)  
相关：感情是真实的。 （谢谢，迈克·S。）
* Never organize anything you should discard.  
永远不要整理任何你应该丢弃的东西。
* Organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling.  
整理你的电子邮件就像按字母顺序排列你的回收品一样。
* As you cross the street, notice which car's driver feels most likely to do something stupid or dangerous. Walk a little slower, turn your head, and make direct eye contact. Brains cannot help but notice faces, plus eye contact startles anyone into suddenly remembering they live amongst other actual people.  
当您过马路时，注意哪辆车的司机最有可能做出愚蠢或危险的事情。走得慢一点，转过头，并进行直接的目光接触。大脑会情不自禁地注意到面孔，再加上目光接触，人们会突然想起自己生活在其他真实的人中间。
* Related corollary: navigate an urban sidewalk by _avoiding_ eye contact. Not because you're anti-social, but because eyes tell you little about where your fellow pedestrians are headed. Monitor feet and footsteps for imminent direction; unfix your gaze \~two head-heights above the crowd to detect emerging patterns.  
相关推论：在城市人行道上行驶时应避免目光接触。不是因为你反社会，而是因为眼睛无法告诉你其他行人的去向。监视脚和脚步声以了解即将发生的方向；松开你的目光\~比人群高出两个头的高度，以发现新出现的模式。
* If the thing you’re cooking doesn’t smell or sound like food yet, it’s probably not food yet.  
如果你正在烹饪的东西闻起来或听起来不像食物，那么它可能还不是食物。
* Buy slightly larger shoes.  
买稍大一点的鞋子。
* Say hello to every dog.  
向每只狗问好。
* Always wave back at children and all persons on trains.  
始终向儿童和火车上的所有人挥手致意。
* Flirt with all elderly women.  
与所有老年妇女调情。
* Tip more. 多给点小费。
* Look for the chimneys.  
寻找烟囱。
* [Keep moving _and_ get out of the way](https://overcast.fm/+BmEPOwtek).  
继续移动并让开。
* _Never_ give advice to a pregnant person unless they specifically asked for it.  
除非孕妇特别要求，否则切勿向其提供建议。
* _Never_ touch a pregnant person unless they specifically asked for it.  
除非孕妇特别要求，否则切勿触摸孕妇。
* _Never_ tell a pregnant person horror stories about childbirth unless they specifically asked for it.  
除非孕妇特别要求，否则切勿向孕妇讲述有关分娩的恐怖故事。
* Corollary: When someone shares something scary about their birth story, it's probably because they're (justifiably) proud of surviving something that they never had imagined that they could survive.  
推论：当有人分享一些关于他们出生故事的可怕事情时，这可能是因为他们（理所当然地）为自己能够幸存下来而感到自豪，而他们从未想过自己能够幸存下来。
* Related: this also goes for most other scary personal anecdotes.  
相关：这也适用于大多数其他可怕的个人轶事。
* Stop correcting people by immediately telling them what they "_should have said_." You are not helping.  
不要立即告诉人们“应该说的话”来纠正他们。你没有帮忙。
* When you’re feeling awful and aren't sure what to do, pretend you are the person you love the most, and give _them_ your best advice.  
当你感觉很糟糕并且不知道该怎么办时，假装你是你最爱的人，并给他们最好的建议。
* Without active care and curation, any area in your home will tend to become "storage."  
如果没有积极的护理和管理，家中的任何区域都可能成为“储藏室”。
* Related: "storage" is the least muscular or affirmative use of space in your life. Live and active areas represent future possibility; "storage" is an emotionally costly way of warehousing the past.  
相关：“存储”是您生活中最不强力或最积极的空间利用。活跃和活跃的区域代表着未来的可能性； “储存”是一种在情感上代价高昂的储存过去的方式。
* If you see someone photographing a group, offer to take the photo for them so they can get in the picture. Please do not steal their camera.  
如果您看到有人在拍摄团体照片，请主动为他们拍照，以便他们可以进入照片。请不要偷他们的相机。
* Related: when you shoot a group photo, always take _at least_ five shots from _at least_ two angles. For the last couple photos, say: "Everybody say _**'BUTTS!'**_" You will instantly get many totally natural smiles, plus you just gave them a fun story.  
相关：当您拍摄集体照时，请务必从至少两个角度拍摄至少五张照片。对于最后几张照片，请说：“每个人都说‘屁股！’”你会立即得到许多完全自然的微笑，而且你刚刚给他们讲了一个有趣的故事。
* In photography—as in life—always keep the light behind you.  
在摄影中，就像在生活中一样，始终将光线留在身后。
* Sometimes, a person will confess something embarrassing that obviously makes them feel really dumb and vulnerable. That is _never_ the time to say "I told you so," and it is rarely the best moment to offer advice that they never asked for. Just shut the fuck up and listen.  
有时，一个人会承认一些令人尴尬的事情，这显然让他们感到非常愚蠢和脆弱。这绝不是说“我告诉过你了”的时候，也很少是提供他们从未要求的建议的最佳时机。就他妈的闭嘴，听着。
* If you have a small household responsibility—no matter how lame or quotidian—just do it now and without being asked. If you think the trash may need to go out, do not "check" to see if the trash needs to go out. Just take out the fucking trash. And quit reminding everybody you took the trash out. This is not Vietnam, and you are not a forgotten hero.  
如果你有一个小小的家庭责任——无论多么蹩脚或平凡——现在就去做，不要被要求。如果您认为垃圾可能需要出去，请不要“检查”垃圾是否需要出去。只要把那些该死的垃圾拿出来就行了。别再提醒大家你把垃圾倒掉了。这不是越南，你也不是被遗忘的英雄。
* Related: the greatest curse of the middle-aged American man is the persistent belief that he is inadequately appreciated.  
相关：美国中年男人最大的诅咒就是坚信自己没有得到足够的赏识。
* Do not ask someone if they want a glass of water. Just bring them a glass of water. Everybody likes being given a glass of water.  
==不要问别人是否想要一杯水。只需给他们一杯水即可。每个人都喜欢被递上一杯水。==
* Buy the nicest screwdrivers you can afford.  
买你能买得起的最好的螺丝刀。
* Every few months, take at least one panorama photo of your kid's room. At least annually, secretly record your kid talking for at least ten minutes. I promise you'll treasure both, and then you will curse yourself for not having done each way more often.  
每隔几个月，至少为孩子的房间拍摄一张全景照片。至少每年一次，秘密地记录你孩子的谈话至少十分钟。我保证你会珍惜这两种方式，然后你会诅咒自己没有更频繁地做这两种方式。
* Most well-written characters have something they want—or something they _think_ they want. The more fascinating characters also have something they don’t want you to know. The best ones also have something they’re not pulling off nearly as well as they think.  
大多数写得好的角色都有他们想要的东西——或者他们认为自己想要的东西。更迷人的角色也有一些他们不想让你知道的事情。最优秀的人也有一些事情并没有像他们想象的那么好。
* Related: these are each also true for real people.  
相关：这些对于真实的人来说也是如此。
* Try always to store something in the first place you just looked for it. Not "where it's pretty" or "where we used to keep it" or "where we have more room." It goes _where it goes_—not where you **think** it goes.  
尝试始终将某些东西存储在您刚刚查找的地方。不是“它漂亮的地方”或“我们过去保存它的地方”或“我们有更多空间的地方”。它会去它去的地方，而不是你认为它去的地方。
* Almost every task in life benefits from the addition of a nearby trash bag.  
生活中几乎每一项任务都受益于附近添加一个垃圾袋。
* Just because you know something doesn't mean everybody knows it. Every day, somebody's born who's never seen _The Flintstones_.  
仅仅因为您知道某件事并不意味着每个人都知道它。每天都会有一些从未看过《摩登原始人》的人出生。
* If an item is especially precious or valuable to you, never set it down anyplace that you wouldn't want it to be overnight.  
如果一件物品对您来说特别珍贵或有价值，切勿将其放在您不希望它过夜的地方。
* Call people what they'd like to be called. And, don't be a dick about it.  
称呼人们喜欢的名字。还有，别对此表现得像个混蛋。
* Frequently ask yourself: do I want to be right, or do I want to be happy?  
==经常问自己：我想要正确，还是想要快乐？==

---

* Every project is a triangle made of time, money, and quality; shortening the length of one side necessarily lengthens one or—more often—_both_ of the other sides.  
每个项目都是由时间、金钱和质量组成的三角形；缩短一侧的长度必然会延长一侧或更常见的是另一侧的两侧。
* Less well known is that we each tend to blow it hardest in estimating the sides of the triangle we least understand or respect.  
鲜为人知的是，我们每个人都倾向于在估计我们最不理解或尊重的三角形边时表现得最努力。
* Kindly note that the grave existential truth of the Project Management Triangle is _non-negotiable_. People **hate** this. Which is normal.  
请注意，项目管理三角存在的严肃事实是不容谈判的。人们讨厌这个。这是正常的。
* If the person with whom you are negotiating finds it difficult to provide a decisive budget estimate for their project, ask them to try and situate it between two orders of magnitude. As in, "How many zeroes are we talking about here?" Quickly discovering that your ballpark figures are 2 to 6 zeroes apart can save you both a _lot_ of time and frustration.  
如果与你谈判的人发现很难为他们的项目提供决定性的预算估算，请让他们尝试将其置于两个数量级之间。就像“我们在这里谈论多少个零？”快速发现您的大概数字相隔 2 到 6 个零，可以为您节省大量时间并减少挫败感。
* Related: if the client's estimate for any given aspect of the project feels poorly thought out, mentally double the estimated budget for money and time. At the end of all estimations, add _at least_ another 20% to the time and budget. You’re gonna need it, and, boy, are you ever going to earn it.  
相关：如果客户对项目的任何特定方面的估计感觉考虑不周，请在心里将金钱和时间的估计预算加倍。在所有估算结束时，至少再增加 20% 的时间和预算。你会需要它，而且，孩子，你能赢得它吗？
* Relatedly related: have you leavened your estimate of the project with your hunches about the credibility of the client? Have you accounted for human foibles and flakiness in your estimate?  
相关相关：您是否根据对客户可信度的预感来调整对项目的估计？您在估算中是否考虑到了人类的弱点和不稳定因素？
* When estimating the time it will take to do anything involving a child, add at least ten minutes per child. Make that 30 minutes for kids under five or over twelve.  
在估计做任何涉及孩子的事情所需的时间时，每个孩子至少增加十分钟。对于 5 岁以下或 12 岁以上的孩子，请预留 30 分钟的时间。
* Always have a twelve-pack of Diet Coke and a good quantity of unflavored fizzy water. A lot of people love one (or both), and most of the people who do drink a lot of it.  
始终备有十二包健怡可乐和大量无味碳酸水。很多人都喜欢其中一种（或两者），而且大多数人都喝很多。
* Whoever wants the meeting most usually holds the least power.  
谁最想要开会，谁的权力通常最小。
* Archive any email that’s older than 30 days. If it kills you to archive a given email, _immediately_ turn it into a task, and then archive it.  
存档所有超过 30 天的电子邮件。如果归档一封给定的电子邮件让你感到头疼，请立即将其变成一项任务，然后将其归档。
* Most team culture comes out of a combination of what is tolerated and what is rewarded. If you legit want your culture to improve, change what you reward and rethink what you will tolerate.  
大多数团队文化都来自于容忍和奖励的结合。如果你确实希望你的文化得到改善，那就改变你的奖励方式并重新考虑你能容忍什么。
* To better understand anyone's childhood, learn which things were _way_ harder for them than they were for you.  
为了更好地了解每个人的童年，了解哪些事情对他们来说比对你来说更困难。
* Any Slack is only as good as the guy who always has the latest post. (And, it's nearly always a guy.)  
任何 Slack 的好坏取决于始终拥有最新帖子的人。 （而且，几乎总是一个男人。）
* Avoid any children’s movie whose theatrical trailer includes more than one fart or butt joke. That’s their idea of the best parts of the movie.  
避免观看任何预告片中包含多个放屁或屁股笑话的儿童电影。这就是他们对电影最好部分的看法。
* If you don't remember what an app does, you can probably delete it.  
如果您不记得某个应用程序的用途，您可以将其删除。
* If you don't remember what a cable does, you can almost definitely discard it.  
如果您不记得电缆的用途，您几乎可以肯定会丢弃它。
* The earlier a kid is around books often (and in _any_ way), the earlier and easier their life of reading will go.  
孩子越早经常（以任何方式）接触书籍，他们的阅读生活就会越早、越容易。
* Any time you locate a piece of digital information you were hunting for, tag it something like, "`#OutboardBrain`." Chances are you'll want to find it again, and chances are you'll definitely forget it again.  
每当您找到要寻找的数字信息时，都可以将其标记为“ `#OutboardBrain` ”。您很可能会想再次找到它，而且很可能您肯定会再次忘记它。
* Avoid vegetarian dishes that aspire to approximate a recipe that’s typically based on meat.  
避免素食菜肴，这些菜肴渴望接近通常以肉类为基础的食谱。
* In any large retail store, choose the line that’s mostly young people who are by themselves.  
在任何一家大型零售店，选择的队伍中大部分都是年轻人。
* Always make _**all**_ the bacon.  
总是做所有的培根。
* Never try to bribe someone unless the amount you’re offering them feels _ludicrously_ high.  
永远不要试图贿赂某人，除非你给他们的金额高得离谱。
* If you really want a glass of water at a restaurant, always order that first. As you do this, look the server in the eyes and nod.  
如果您确实想在餐厅喝一杯水，请务必先点。执行此操作时，请看着服务器的眼睛并点头。
* You’ll probably need to listen to at least three episodes of a podcast before you will know if you could _really_ love it.  
您可能需要至少听三集播客才能知道自己是否真的喜欢它。
* If you want an honest opinion, ask for the second superlative. For example, if you want a thoughtful answer about someone's job, ask them their _second-least-favorite_ thing about it.  
如果您想要诚实的意见，请要求第二个最高级。例如，如果您想得到有关某人工作的深思熟虑的答案，请询问他们最不喜欢的事情。
* Avoid any food whose name has been altered for legal reasons. (Thanks, Chris C.)  
避免购买任何因法律原因更改名称的食品。 （谢谢，克里斯·C.）

---

* Sometimes, people ask you how you're doing when they're especially concerned about how _they’re_ doing.  
有时，当人们特别关心自己的表现时，他们会问你做得怎么样。
* Stay focused on the outcome, not your original strategy. Viz.: if you’re looking for _a_ USB cable, don't fixate on finding a _specific_ box that might contain a _specific_ USB cable. Just find _a_ goddamned cable.  
专注于结果，而不是最初的策略。即：如果您正在寻找 USB 电缆，请不要专注于寻找可能包含特定 USB 电缆的特定盒子。只要找到一根该死的电缆即可。
* Related: when you get stuck and frustrated about how to solve a problem, stop, take a breath, and ask yourself, “What am I _actually_ trying to accomplish here?” Because, that’s the outcome on the other side of a new and less ambiguous strategy.  
相关：当你对如何解决问题感到困惑和沮丧时，停下来，深呼吸，问自己，“我在这里实际上想完成什么？”因为，这是新的、更明确的战略的另一面的结果。
* Relatedly related: whenever you catch yourself getting frustrated because you're hung up on some weird implementation detail, please say the following outloud in a firm but friendly tone: "_Just do the thing_."  
相关相关：每当你发现自己因为沉迷于一些奇怪的实现细节而感到沮丧时，请用坚定但友好的语气大声说出以下内容：“就做这件事。”
* Before you freak out about how you are feeling right now, ask yourself how much (or how little) you're having of sleep, food, sex, water, exercise, alcohol, drugs, sunshine, human touch, family time, and probably some other stuff I don't know of but you definitely will.  
在你担心自己现在的感受之前，问问自己你有多少（或多少）睡眠、食物、性、水、锻炼、酒精、药物、阳光、人际交往、家庭时间，以及可能的睡眠、食物、性、水、锻炼、酒精、药物、阳光、人际交往、家庭时间，以及还有一些我不知道但你肯定会的东西。
* Whenever you need to carry two seemingly identical things (like, drinks or toothbrushes or what have you), always—_and only_—ever carry the one that’s yours in your right hand. When you pick up the two items, always mutter aloud to yourself, “_I’m always **right**_.” Because, now, you are always right.  
每当您需要携带两件看似相同的东西（例如饮料或牙刷或您拥有的其他物品）时，请始终（且仅）用右手携带您的那件。当你拿起这两件物品时，一定要大声对自己说：“我总是对的。”因为，现在，你永远是对的。
* After you’ve had two alcoholic beverages, begin alternating with equal amounts of water. If you have more than five drinks, change that ratio to two-to one in favor of water. (Thanks, Dennis. G.)  
喝完两杯酒精饮料后，开始交替喝等量的水。如果您喝了五杯以上的饮料，请将比例更改为二比一，改喝水。 （谢谢，丹尼斯.G.）
* Dinner parties and most large group meals are not really about eating. They’re mostly about easy socializing. So, if you get weird when you’re hungry, _eat before you arrive_. It’ll make everyone's evening more easy and more social.  
晚宴和大多数大型团体聚餐并不是真正的饮食。它们主要是为了轻松社交。因此，如果您感到饥饿时感到奇怪，请在到达之前吃点东西。这将使每个人的夜晚变得更加轻松、更加社交。

---

* Sometimes in life, even though it's not your _fault_, it's still your problem. (Thanks, Marco A.)  
生活中有时候，即使这不是你的错，但仍然是你的问题。 （谢谢，马可 A。）
* Being on time for things is a sign of character and respect. Adults who are pathologically late for things are unconsciously telling the world that other people's time is worthless to them.  
准时做事是品格和尊重的标志。那些病态迟到的成年人无意识地告诉世界，别人的时间对他们来说毫无价值。
* To clean out a junky drawer, remove the contents and put it in a box. Only when you've used one of the items in the box _twice_ is it allowed to live in the drawer again. After a month, pitch or donate the remaining contents—or move the precious or useful stuff to deeper storage. But, yeah, you should probably just pitch it.  
要清理垃圾抽屉，请取出里面的东西并将其放入盒子中。只有当你使用了盒子里的一件物品两次后，它才可以再次存放在抽屉里。一个月后，推销或捐赠剩余的内容，或者将珍贵或有用的东西移至更深的存储位置。但是，是的，你也许应该推销它。
* Never argue on the internet. No one will remember whether you won or lost the argument; they'll just remember that you are the sort of person who argues on the internet.  
切勿在互联网上争论。没有人会记得你是赢了还是输了；他们只会记住你是那种在互联网上争论的人。
* Whatever your problem is, remember that before you can get better, you have to stop getting worse. Try first to stop getting worse.  
无论你的问题是什么，请记住，在你变得更好之前，你必须停止变得更糟。首先尝试停止变得更糟。
* Don't let people tell you whether, when, or how to season your food. It's your body.  
不要让别人告诉您是否、何时或如何给食物调味。这是你的身体。
* Just in general: never explain food. Yes, I see the provided sauce. And, no, I do not need a webinar on how it should be deployed.  
一般来说：永远不要解释食物。是的，我看到提供的酱汁。而且，不，我不需要关于如何部署它的网络研讨会。
* Whenever someone demands you change who you are, it's useful to ask yourself what they stand to gain from you agreeing to become someone else.  
每当有人要求你改变自己时，问问自己，如果你同意成为别人，他们会得到什么，这是很有用的。
* To an anxious person, it often feels like the only way to achieve relaxed certainty is to keep seeking new information. But, remember that the more you know, the more you'll realize you don't know. And, then, you'll usually just find yourself fretting about getting more and more information, et cetera. Incline yourself towards getting out of the information centrifuge.  
对于焦虑的人来说，通常感觉获得轻松确定性的唯一方法就是不断寻找新信息。但是，请记住，您知道的越多，您就会意识到自己不知道的越多。然后，您通常会发现自己为获取越来越多的信息而烦恼，等等。让自己摆脱信息离心机。
* Everybody grieves differently. You're not the mourning police, and no one benefits from you telling them they're being sad wrong.  
每个人的悲伤方式都不同。你不是哀悼的警察，你告诉他们他们的悲伤是错误的，没有人会从中受益。
* "Experience" is rarely the verb you're looking for. Reword your sentence with a more clear and muscular focus on what actually happened—and who or what caused it to happen. So, maybe don't say "I am experiencing technical difficulties" if you really mean "I broke the internet." You're not fooling anyone.  
“经验”很少是您要寻找的动词。改写你的句子，更清晰、更有力地关注实际发生的事情，以及是谁或什么导致了它的发生。因此，如果您的真正意思是“我破坏了互联网”，也许不要说“我遇到技术困难”。你没有欺骗任何人。
* Related. Please don't say "impact" (v.) if you just mean "affect" (v.). It makes you sound like a lame PowerPoint about dentistry.  
有关的。如果您只是指“影响”(v.)，请不要说“影响”(v.)。这让你听起来像是一个蹩脚的关于牙科的幻灯片。
* Few journalists get to choose the headline for their piece. So, whenever the clickbait of a terrible, search-engine-optimized headline belies an actually-good article, consider getting mad at the editor. Not the writer.

收集和囤积是完全不同的事情。如果它被积极地展示和策划，那么它只是一个“集合”。另一方面，六本未读杂志并不是一个集合；而是一个集合。这是一个回收项目，也是个人的痛苦。

* Corollary: If you're only tentatively committed to a calendar item—especially if the time of the event has not been mutually confirmed—title the event using Spanish-language questions marks.

推论：如果您只是暂时承诺某个日历项目（尤其是活动时间尚未相互确认），请使用西班牙语问号为活动命名。像“ `¿Pick apples with Aunt Sue?` ”这样的未来事件成功地节省了时间，同时还提供了有关仍需要正式化或删除的事件的快速可扫描提醒。

Keys, wallet, phone, etc. That's why, when you _are_ at home, they always (and only) ever belong in exactly one place—a bowl, a shelf, a hook, or what have you. Setting them down anyplace else is madness, and you know in your heart that this is true.  
当您离开家时，有些东西是您始终想要随身携带的。钥匙、钱包、电话等。这就是为什么当你在家时，它们总是（且只）属于同一个地方——碗、架子、钩子或你拥有的任何东西。把它们放在其他地方是疯狂的，你心里知道这是真的。

想法和感受是真实的，但它们不必定义你。请记住，你是天空，而不是天气。 （谢谢，佩玛·C.）

避免出现您所爱的人稍后可能需要在医疗或政府表格上解释的情况。

将您发送的每封电子邮件视为一颗鹅卵石。对你来说，它可能看起来像一个滑稽的小东西——在尺寸和重量上几乎不存在。但是，对于已经拥有数百颗其他人的鹅卵石的接收者来说，接收哪怕是一颗更小的鹅卵石也不是没有成本的。

==爱书和爱读书是截然不同的两件事。一是珍惜书面文字的无价礼物，二是不断告诉陌生人你有多么热爱书籍。==

如果你能做到的话，请避免在媒体建议中说“我不能再推荐这个了”。因为如果听者（可以理解）在听到那个关键的最后一个词时走神了，听起来你真的有点讨厌它。
* Learn the difference between being "busy" versus being _time-constrained_. Time constraint is an immutable fact of adult life; while it can (and should) be managed, time constraint can never be eradicated. Being "busy" should be better understood as a time-limited result of an earlier management error. If you find that your busy-ness has become permanent, you must learn to manage earlier, differently, and much _much_ better.  
了解“忙碌”与“时间有限”之间的区别。时间限制是成人生活中不可改变的事实。虽然可以（而且应该）对其进行管理，但时间限制永远无法消除。 “忙碌”应该更好地理解为早期管理错误的有限时间结果。如果你发现你的忙碌已经成为永久性的，你必须学会​​更早、以不同的方式、更好地进行管理。
* Related: start acting like your life matters.  
相关：开始表现得像你的生活很重要一样。

* Start noticing how often you explain away stasis, trauma, codependence, abuse, or generally unwholesome situations because of something you claim that you "**have**" to do.

如果确实是威胁，请不要将其称为“警告”。 “小心步行上学”是一个警告； “我要轰炸你的学校”是一种威胁。

* When you first try to meditate, it'll feel like you're doing it wrong and are terrible at it. Eventually, you'll figure out that being terrible at meditation and feeling like you're doing it wrong is kind of the whole point of meditation. In truth, as long as you keep getting back to your practice, you are actually great at meditation, and you are doing very well at it.  
当你第一次尝试冥想时，你会感觉自己做错了，而且做得很糟糕。最终，你会发现冥想的全部意义在于，冥想很糟糕并且感觉自己做错了。事实上，只要你不断地回到练习中，你实际上就很擅长冥想，而且做得很好。

我们无法选择我们喜欢什么或什么让我们哭泣。寻求与那些支持让你哭泣或饥渴的事物的人建立关系。
* Try to save some parts of your life to be just for you. Including some special things that you're happy about or are even a little proud of. If your only private things are shameful things, you will become very sad and will eventually despise your own company.  
尝试保留你生活中的某些部分，只为你自己。包括一些让你感到高兴甚至有点自豪的特别的事情。如果你唯一的私人事情是可耻的事情，你会变得非常悲伤，最终会鄙视自己的公司。

==在购买新书之前，请尝试从图书馆获取一本，或者只是下载电子书样本。如果您无法读完 Kindle 示例，那么您当然不应该为不阅读其余部分而付费。==

最痴迷于陌生人（所谓的）虚伪的人往往是最害怕陌生人揭露自己虚伪的人。这使得其中许多人有点难以忍受，而且和他们一起出去玩也不是很有趣。
* Related: there are numerous things in life worse and more damaging than hypocrisy. Including the implicit belief that eventually changing to become a little less of a jerk must be excoriated for its rank "hypocrisy."  
相关：生活中有很多事情比虚伪更糟糕、更具破坏性。包括一种隐含的信念，即最终变得不再那么混蛋，必须因其等级“虚伪”而受到严厉斥责。
* Before deciding that you have solved a problem, it's useful to ask yourself whether you understand what _caused_ the problem—as well as knowing precisely how your specific choice of solution has "fixed" it. If you mostly just kept trying various random things until something seemed to improve, you just got lucky. Which is different.  
在确定您已经解决了问题之前，问问自己是否了解导致问题的原因，以及准确地了解您选择的具体解决方案是如何“解决”问题的，这很有用。如果你只是不断尝试各种随机的事情，直到某些事情似乎有所改善，那么你只是运气好。这是不同的。
* Whenever you acquire anything that has a manual, Google for a PDF of it, then drop it in a folder on your cloud service of choice.  
每当您获得任何带有手册的东西时，请在 Google 上查找 PDF 版本，然后将其放入您选择的云服务上的文件夹中。
* It's mostly to young people's credit and benefit that they rarely realize that youth and its advantages are anomalous. Youth is all you have ever known in life until you reach an age when you are no longer young. At which point, you are likely to develop a strong hunch that your own youth was absolutely an anomaly.  
这主要是年轻人的功劳和利益，他们很少意识到年轻及其优势是异常的。青春是你一生中所知道的一切，直到你到达不再年轻的年龄。在这一点上，你可能会产生一种强烈的预感，认为自己的青春绝对是一个异常现象。
* Unless you are cannily identifying a specific logical fallacy, the question has likely been _raised_. Not begged.  
除非你精明地发现了一个特定的逻辑谬误，否则这个问题很可能已经被提出了。没有哀求。
* Consider using less corn starch than the recipe demands.  
考虑使用比食谱要求更少的玉米淀粉。
* Being good at arguing is not the same thing as being right; being bad at arguing is not the same thing as being wrong.  
善于争论并不等于正确；善于争论并不等于正确。不善于争论并不等于犯错。
* It is normal and human to fear things that you don't understand. But, seeking to understand something does _not_ mean you have to like it or agree with it. It may, however, suddenly make some of your fears feel refreshingly optional.  
害怕你不理解的事情是正常的，也是人性的。但是，寻求理解某件事并不意味着你必须喜欢它或同意它。然而，它可能会突然让你的一些恐惧变得令人耳目一新，是可选的。
* Carry more Imodium than you think you will ever need. They are compact in size, light in weight, and miraculously effective at keeping you from suddenly needing to shit egregiously at times and locations when you'd prefer not to be shitting egregiously.  
携带比您认为需要的更多的易蒙停。它们尺寸紧凑，重量轻，并且奇迹般地有效地防止您在您不想大便的时间和地点突然需要大便。
* Related: Imodium works by sucking liquid out of your bowels, so compensate by drinking more water than you normally would. The Imodium will still work fine.  
相关：易蒙停的作用是从肠道中吸出液体，因此请比平常喝更多的水来补偿。 Imodium 仍然可以正常工作。
* Relatedly related: several Imodiums will fit conveniently in the right-side "watch pocket" of a pair Levi's. Ditto guitar picks, a small USB drive, or some quarters with which to play the excellent 1981 arcade game, "Galaga."  
相关相关：几款 Imodium 可以方便地放入李维斯 (Levi's) 的右侧“表袋”中。同样的吉他拨片、一个小型 USB 驱动器或一些用来玩 1981 年出色的街机游戏“Galaga”的硬币。

* Most parents understand it's their job to keep their child from dying. But, as the kid gets older, it also becomes increasingly vital not to prevent them from living. This is very difficult.  
大多数父母都明白，防止孩子死亡是他们的工作。但是，随着孩子长大，不阻止他们生活也变得越来越重要。这是非常困难的。
* If you're going to participate in a dumb fight online, do it in the late afternoon. That way, you're less likely to blow a perfectly good working day being all mad. Plus, you'll both tire yourselves out eventually, and maybe you'll do better tomorrow.  
如果您要参加在线愚蠢的战斗，请在下午晚些时候进行。这样，你就不太可能因为发疯而毁掉完美的工作日。另外，你们最终都会疲惫不堪，也许明天你们会做得更好。
* Related: do not participate in dumb fights online.  
相关：不要参加网上愚蠢的战斗。
* Minimize the number of conversations you have through a closed bathroom door. Unless you're outside the door and there's a fire, or you're _inside_ the door and you're out of toilet paper. Otherwise, have a little dignity, and wait for the door to open.  
尽量减少通过关着的浴室门进行的谈话。除非你在门外并且发生了火灾，或者你在门内并且卫生纸用完了。否则，有点尊严，等待门打开。
* Don't be too thirsty in your quest for gratitude and acknowledgement. If you want to help someone and have the requisite skills, _just help them_. A person with a problem who also has to graciously manage needy communications about that problem now very much has two problems.  
不要太渴望寻求感激和认可。如果您想帮助某人并具备必要的技能，那就帮助他们吧。一个有问题的人还必须慷慨地管理有关该问题的有需要的沟通，现在他有两个问题。
* Related: if you _really_ want to help someone, offer something extremely specific. "I'm here for you! 😬👍" is not nearly as cool as "Can I drop off a lasagna at 4?"  
相关：如果你真的想帮助某人，请提供一些非常具体的东西。 “我在这里等你！😬👍”并不像“我可以在四点送一份烤宽面条吗？”那么酷。
* You cannot alter history by choosing not to use words. But, you do stand a small chance of improving the future by choosing better words.  
你无法通过选择不使用文字来改变历史。但是，你确实有很小的机会通过选择更好的词语来改善未来。
* Learn to play guitar. It takes, like, two weeks. And, once you kinda know what you're doing, you can play songs you like or just keep your hands occupied while you're thinking.  
学习弹吉他。这需要大约两周的时间。而且，一旦您知道自己在做什么，您就可以播放您喜欢的歌曲，或者在思考时让双手闲着。
* Related: a ukulele-sized six-string guitar (or, _guitalele_) is a portable, affordable, small-footprint instrument that you can just have around the house. Plus, they're super fun to play.  
相关：尤克里里大小的六弦吉他（或吉塔莱）是一种便携式、价格实惠、占地面积小的乐器，您可以在家中随身携带。另外，它们玩起来超级有趣。
* While it's weird to _invent_ a tradition, start noticing the things that have made you happy when (or because) they've happened more than once. Then, consider acknowledging those things as a tradition.  
虽然发明一种传统很奇怪，但开始注意那些让你快乐的事情，当它们发生不止一次时（或因为它们发生过一次）。然后，考虑承认这些事情是一种传统。
* Related: some of the best traditions are silly or weird or trivial traditions. Traditions related to repeating events like holidays can be a lot of fun and even very moving. But, you may discover that your new favorite traditions are just the dumb group rituals that arise amongst people who like each other and quietly treasure the hours and years they've spent sharing mundane things.  
相关：一些最好的传统是愚蠢的、奇怪的或琐碎的传统。与节日等重复事件相关的传统可能会很有趣，甚至非常感人。但是，您可能会发现，您最喜欢的新传统只是愚蠢的集体仪式，这些仪式出现在彼此喜欢的人们之间，并静静地珍惜他们花在分享平凡事物上的时间和岁月。
* Xerox or scan the non-currency contents of your wallet twice a year. You'll likely regard this as a weird waste of effort until the day it saves your bacon.  
每年两次复印或扫描钱包中的非货币内容。你可能会认为这是一种奇怪的浪费精力的行为，直到有一天它能拯救你的培根。
* Tip the hotel housekeeping staff. Tip them handsomely. If you had to clean _their_ toilet, wouldn't you appreciate a little something for the effort?  
给酒店客房服务人员小费。给他们丰厚的小费。如果你必须打扫他们的厕所，你不会因为你的努力而感激一些吗？
* Be conservative about how much stuff you accumulate because you imagine someone "might want it someday." If you're warehousing something that feels like a minor heirloom, ask the person if they want it right now, and when they inevitably say, "Oh, my God, _**NO!**_" be gracious in defeat, and just find it a good home with a charity or a trash can.  
对于你积累的东西要保守，因为你想象有人“有一天可能会想要它”。如果你正在仓储一些感觉像是小传家宝的东西，询问那个人他们现在是否想要它，当他们不可避免地说：“哦，天哪，不！”失败时要仁慈，找到一个有慈善机构或垃圾桶的好家。
* Related: charities, homeless shelters, and schools do not need your filthy or broken shit; they need your money. So, just give them some cash, and stop treating "worthy causes" like a guilt-free DMZ for your junk.  
相关：慈善机构、无家可归者收容所和学校不需要你肮脏或破烂的粪便；他们需要你的钱。所以，只要给他们一些现金，别再把“有价值的事业”当作无罪的非军事区对待你的垃圾了。
* Relatedly related: quit buying products because "a portion of the proceeds goes to charity." If you actually care about a cause, give that cause some actual money. Then, you'll know _all_ of the proceeds have gone to charity.  
相关相关：停止购买产品，因为“部分收益捐给了慈善机构”。如果你真的关心某个事业，就给这个事业一些实际的钱。然后，您就会知道所有收益都捐给了慈善机构。
* If there's a book that means a lot to you, buy five print copies. It helps the author, plus now you can give a free copy to a friend whom you think would love it.  
如果有一本书对您来说意义重大，请购买五本印刷版。它对作者很有帮助，而且现在您可以将免费副本送给您认为会喜欢它的朋友。
* When you get coins as change, throw them in a jar and forget about it. That's now your baby steps toward savings, a vacation, or what have you.  
当你得到硬币作为零钱时，把它们扔进罐子里然后忘记它。现在，您的宝宝正在迈向储蓄、度假或其他您拥有的东西。
* Alternatively: leave your spare coins in a tidy little stack right outside the store you just exited. I'll bet you a chicken dinner the person who finds them could use them a lot more than you.  
或者：将多余的硬币放在刚刚退出的商店外面整齐的小堆中。我敢跟你打赌，找到鸡肉的人会比你更多地使用它们。
* When you die, your family will be charged $100 for every time you've ever honked your car horn. I cannot tell you how I know this, but please just understand with all sober certainty how very important it is that you never again honk your car horn.  
当您去世后，您的家人将因您每次按汽车喇叭而被收取 100 美元的费用。我无法告诉你我是如何知道这一点的，但请你清醒地理解，永远不要再按喇叭是多么重要。

* If you're noticing a new name or phrase being used to refer to something you know by an older or more familiar name, try to keep an open mind. Rather than focusing on your own annoyance or discomfort, ask yourself in which direction the new name is encouraging people to move. If it feels like a good faith step toward inclusion, authenticity, kindness, or greater humanity, maybe set aside your priors and make the effort to take those positive steps right along with it.  
如果您发现一个新名称或短语被用来指代您所知道的旧名称或更熟悉的名称，请尝试保持开放的态度。不要把注意力集中在自己的烦恼或不适上，而是问问自己新名称鼓励人们朝哪个方向移动。如果这感觉像是迈向包容、真实、善良或更人性的真诚一步，也许可以抛开你的先入之见，努力采取这些积极的步骤。
* But: remain skeptical about quickly adopting new jargon from the worlds of business, technology, or journalism. Especially if it's that sort of new jargon that enthusiastically trades clarity and precision for deliberate opacity or cheap novelty. The track record for jargon's longterm contributions to society has been bleak.  
但是：对快速采用商业、技术或新闻领域的新术语保持怀疑。尤其是当这种新术语热衷于用清晰度和精确性来换取故意的不透明或廉价的新奇时。行话对社会的长期贡献的记录一直很暗淡。
* Be suspicious of people who like being owed a favor. Especially if it's not a favor that you requested. Often, these people are eldritch monsters who thrive on accumulating goodwill for darkly selfish reasons.  
对那些喜欢受人恩惠的人要保持怀疑。特别是如果这不是您请求的帮助。通常，这些人都是可怕的怪物，他们出于黑暗自私的原因靠积累善意而茁壮成长。
* If the soap in a guest bathroom is new and shaped like anything besides a bar of soap, do not use it. Also, do not eat it. Because I know you kinda want to. Especially those shiny little sea shells.  
如果客用浴室中的肥皂是新的并且形状与肥皂不同，请勿使用它。另外，不要吃它。因为我知道你有点想要。尤其是那些闪闪发光的小贝壳。
* If you're not sure who's doing your emotional labor, it's probably everyone you know.  
如果你不确定谁在为你做情感劳动，那可能就是你认识的每个人。
* When you order delivery food from a new place that looks promising, use it as an opportunity to explore. Set a baseline by ordering a dish you love, especially if it seems hard to screw up. But, as a flyer, also consider ordering an appetizer or side dish they claim people love.  
当您从一个看起来很有前途的新地方订购外卖时，请将其作为探索的机会。点一道你喜欢的菜来设定一个基线，尤其是当它看起来很难搞砸的时候。但是，作为一名乘客，也可以考虑点一份他们声称人们喜欢的开胃菜或配菜。
* When you order delivery food on behalf of a child, and you have a special request whose contravention risks ruining their meal, don't be squeamish about it. Just say, "No mustard, please. It's for a kid."  
当您代表孩子订购外卖食品时，如果您有特殊要求，而违反该要求可能会毁掉他们的饭菜，请不要对此感到拘谨。只要说：“请不要放芥末。这是给孩子吃的。”
* Related: maybe think twice before telling the order-taker about a (non-existent) allergy that you claim gravely constrains your diet. A lot of people do this, restaurants know it, and it ends up harming the people who actually do have an actual allergy. A strong preference rarely rises to the level of being an emergent medical issue.  
相关：在告诉点餐员你声称严重限制你的饮食的（不存在的）过敏之前，可能要三思而后行。很多人都会这样做，餐馆也知道这一点，但它最终会伤害那些真正有过敏症的人。强烈的偏好很少会上升到紧急医疗问题的程度。
* Relatedly related: if you really don't want mustard on your food? Yeah, maybe just tell them "It's for a kid."  
相关相关：如果您真的不想在食物中添加芥末？是的，也许只是告诉他们“这是给孩子的”。
* In between "yes" and "no" is a powerful thing called _the qualified 'yes.'_ Responsible and self-aware adults have every right to place conditions on their agreeing to do almost anything. And, trust me that the people who either reject or ignore this seeming subtlety are rarely the sort of people to whom you want to be making _any_ kind of commitments.  
在“是”和“否”之间有一个强有力的东西，称为限定“是”。有责任感和有自知之明的成年人完全有权为他们同意做的几乎任何事情设定条件。而且，相信我，拒绝或忽视这种看似微妙的人很少是你想要对其做出任何承诺的人。
* If someone asks you to critique their work, try to gauge what it is they're actually looking for. Many people just want a friend's praise, others may be seeking insight on how close they are to being finished, while a rare few crave the most candid and withering feedback you can muster.  
如果有人要求您批评他们的工作，请尝试衡量他们真正想要的是什么。许多人只是想要朋友的赞扬，其他人可能想了解他们距离完成还有多远，而极少数人则渴望你能收集到的最坦诚和最严厉的反馈。
* Related: people who are _accustomed_ to receiving honest feedback are often really good at providing focus on what they specifically need help with, as well as context for why your advice would be useful to them right now. If their big question is "So, do you love it?" you are likely not talking to one of those people.  
相关：习惯于接受诚实反馈的人通常非常擅长关注他们特别需要帮助的内容，以及为什么你的建议现在对他们有用的背景。如果他们的大问题是“那么，你喜欢它吗？”您可能没有与这些人中的任何一个交谈。
* Success in relationships—especially in marriage—will largely come down to how many things only one person is ever allowed to be right about.  
人际关系——尤其是婚姻——的成功很大程度上取决于有多少事情只允许一个人是正确的。

* Piles can be a quick and dirty way to tidy an area or organize a bunch of stuff. But, temporary piles tend to devolve into permanent piles, and permanent piles are struggling to warn that you are becoming neither tidy nor organized.  
堆放是一种快速但肮脏的方式来整理一个区域或整理一堆东西。但是，临时堆往往会演变成永久堆，而永久堆则在努力警告您变得既不整洁又没有组织。
* When removing a full bag from a trash can, consider dropping a folded-up future replacement bag at the bottom of the can. This will seem weird and unnecessary until the day you hadn't realized you've run out of trash bags, and then—hey—free bonus bags.  
从垃圾桶中取出装满的袋子时，请考虑将折叠起来的未来替换袋子放在垃圾桶底部。这看起来很奇怪而且没有必要，直到有一天你没有意识到你已经用完了垃圾袋，然后——嘿——免费的奖励袋。
* IKEA's blue _FRAKTA_ shopping bags are one of life's low-key power tools. They fold ridiculously small, so they can live unobtrusively in places like automobiles or even other bags, like suitcases. Because, some day you may suddenly wish you had _freaking nineteen gallons_ of extra bag with you.  
宜家的蓝色 FRAKTA 弗拉克塔 购物袋是生活中低调的电动工具之一。它们折叠得小得离谱，因此可以不引人注目地生活在汽车等地方，甚至可以放在手提箱等其他袋子里。因为，有一天您可能会突然希望随身携带十九加仑的额外袋子。
* If you're going to hide a spare house key, consider putting it somewhere that's not right outside your house. Even an industrious prowler is less likely to gain easy access to your home if your unmarked spare is tucked behind a neighbor's picnic table or buried under a rock in the park.  
如果您要隐藏备用的房门钥匙，请考虑将其放在屋外以外的地方。如果您的未标记的备用设备藏在邻居的野餐桌后面或埋在公园的岩石下，即使是勤奋的徘徊者也不太可能轻松进入您的家。
* The potent powdered stuff used to clean espresso machines is also a kick-ass solution for soaking nasty cookware.  
用于清洁浓缩咖啡机的强效粉末状物质也是浸泡肮脏炊具的绝佳解决方案。
* You are using too much dish soap. Use less dish soap but hotter water.  
您使用了过多的洗洁精。少用洗洁精，但用热水。
* Buy some manila file folder jackets, and deploy them for any occasion or destination where random paper kipple is likely to pile up. You know that wad of receipts and boarding passes and theme park maps and whatnot that accumulate every time you travel? Anticipate the wad, and then easily manage it with your new folder friend. It would like to live right next to your room's ad hoc charging station, please.  
购买一些马尼拉文件夹夹克，并将它们部署到可能堆积随机纸张的任何场合或目的地。您知道每次旅行时都会积累一堆收据、登机牌、主题公园地图以及诸如此类的东西吗？预测该文件，然后与您的新文件夹朋友轻松管理它。请它住在您房间的临时充电站旁边。
* When you get multiple hotel key cards for the multiple people in your party, use stickers or a Sharpie to identify whose card is whose. Seems dumb until you realize too late that one person has left the room with three cards and two people have left the room with zero cards.  
当您为聚会中的多人获得多张酒店钥匙卡时，请使用贴纸或记号笔来识别谁的卡是谁的。这看起来很愚蠢，直到你意识到一个人带着三张牌离开房间而两个人带着零张牌离开房间时已经太晚了。
* If you're about to depart for an event that requires physical pre-purchased tickets, every person in your party has to hold their own ticket to their own forehead. Then, you don't leave until the entire group agrees that they've all seen each person's ticket. (Thanks, Phil S.)  
如果您要出发去参加需要预先购买实体门票的活动，则队伍中的每个人都必须将自己的门票放在自己的额头上。然后，直到整个团队都同意他们都看到了每个人的票后，您才能离开。 （谢谢，菲尔·S。）
* You're either on the bus or off the bus. (thanks Ken K.)  
你要么在公交车上，要么在公交车下。 （感谢肯·K。）
* related: this also goes for doors, lids, locks, and relationships.  
相关：这也适用于门、盖子、锁和关系。
* relatedly related: your ear buds are only ever allowed to be in one of two places _ever_. They are either in your ears or in their charging case. That is it. Ever. (Thanks, John S.)  
相关相关：您的耳塞只能放置在两个位置之一。它们要么在您的耳朵里，要么在充电盒中。这就对了。曾经。 （谢谢，约翰·S。）

* Whenever you switch to having two of something, change is happening, and you need to be aware of that. If you had one lover, but then suddenly find yourself with two, change is afoot. If you recently had one-thousand dollars, but are now down to two? Something big has changed.  
每当你转向拥有两件东西时，变化就在发生，你需要意识到这一点。如果你有一个情人，但突然发现自己有两个情人，那么变化正在发生。如果您最近有一千美元，但现在减少到两美元？有一些大的事情发生了变化。
* Related: this also goes for keys, college majors, addictions, indictments, toilet paper rolls, wishes from a genie, and almost everything else. "Two" often means shit is on the precipice of getting extremely weird.  
相关：这也适用于钥匙、大学专业、成瘾、起诉书、卫生纸卷、精灵的愿望，以及几乎所有其他东西。 “二”通常意味着狗屎正处于变得极其奇怪的边缘。
* Like it or not, you're always practicing _something_. Put another way, whichever muscle you exercise the most can't help but strengthen. Often to the detriment of others.  
不管你喜欢与否，你总是在练习一些东西。换句话说，无论你锻炼最多的肌肉，都会不可避免地增强力量。往往会损害他人的利益。
* Related: okay, that was mostly an analogy. What I'm saying is that you will eventually _become_ whatever you frequently do. So, be picky about frequently doing only the things that help aid whatever it is you _want_ to become.  
相关：好吧，这主要是一个类比。我的意思是，你最终会成为你经常做的事情。因此，要谨慎行事，不要经常只做那些有助于帮助你成为你想成为的人的事情。
* No one speaks through a translator; it is we who _listen_ through a translator.  
没有人通过翻译说话；是我们通过翻译来听。
* Your refrigerator is not a library or a hope chest. So, if you decide to save some leftovers, write the current day of the week on them. Then, when you rediscover your treat 3-5 weeks from now and wonder "Now, _which_ Sunday was that?" Yeah. Time to deeply curate your odd little food museum.  
您的冰箱不是图书馆或希望之箱。因此，如果您决定保留一些剩菜，请在上面写下当天是星期几。然后，当您在 3-5 周后重新发现您的美食时，会想“现在，那是哪个星期天？”是的。是时候深入策划你奇怪的小食品博物馆了。
* Related: good intentions to reduce waste are best operationalized before acquiring the things that tend to get wasted. Live the rule of the buffet: "Take what you want, but eat what you take."  
相关：减少浪费的良好意愿最好在购买容易浪费的东西之前付诸实践。遵守自助餐的规则：“拿你想要的东西，但吃你拿的东西。”
* Life would be simpler if we got to choose which things made us a little less dumb or ugly. If something has made you rethink how you roll, just humbly take the win, and keep getting better without regard to what caused it and when.  
如果我们必须选择哪些事情能让我们不那么愚蠢或丑陋，生活就会变得更简单。如果某件事让你重新思考如何滚动，只需谦虚地接受胜利，并不断进步，不管是什么原因和何时造成的。
* As you get older, you will increasingly fear losing power, and you will become bitter, defensive, and angry about change. Curiosity, acceptance, and exposure to new people can help with this. But, man are you ever going to get weird about people with purple hair who are not afraid of you.  
随着年龄的增长，你会越来越害怕失去权力，你会对变化变得痛苦、防御和愤怒。好奇心、接受度和接触新朋友可以帮助做到这一点。但是，伙计，你会对那些不怕你的紫色头发的人感到奇怪吗？
* Related: almost no one has ever _actually_ been afraid of you.  
相关：几乎没有人真正害怕过你。
* Relatedly related: the only people who were ever _actually_ afraid of you were the handful of people who loved you and desperately wanted you to love them back.  
相关的：唯一真正害怕你的人是少数爱你并迫切希望你也爱他们的人。
* For chrissakes, get a new kitchen sponge already.  
老天啊，买一块新的厨房海绵吧。

* Remember that, like babies and balls, you can bounce. The extent to which any given event—often an imagined event—might derail or even destroy you is, at least in small ways, still something that's in your control. Especially when you remember that you can bounce.  
请记住，就像婴儿和球一样，您可以弹跳。任何特定事件（通常是想象的事件）可能在多大程度上使你脱轨甚至毁灭，至少在很小的方面，仍然是你可以控制的。尤其是当你记得你可以弹跳时。
* Whenever the start time for a call or similar gets delayed—even for a theoretically specific time in just a few minutes—consider asking your tardy colleague for a "_bump_." "Text me when you're ready—but, then give me 15 minutes" allows your brain to move fully out of "waiting mode" and into "doing stuff mode." If the event ends up starting promptly at the new time? (Which it won't.) Great. And, if it doesn't start on time? (Which it won't). No problem. You will have disappeared into an appropriately-sized task instead of being all mad about transitively wasting time and attention that could have been more skillfully utilized.  
每当通话或类似事件的开始时间被延迟时（即使是理论上的特定时间只有几分钟），请考虑向迟到的同事请求“加急”。 “准备好后给我发短信——但是，然后给我 15 分钟”可以让你的大脑完全脱离“等待模式”并进入“做事模式”。如果活动最终在新时间立即开始？ （但不会。） 太好了。而且，如果没有准时开始呢？ （但不会）。没问题。你会消失在一个适当大小的任务中，而不是因为浪费时间和注意力而生气，而这些时间和注意力本来可以被更巧妙地利用。
* In considering whether and how often to ingest a source of new or updating information, always try to ask yourself: "What might this make me want to see, think, or do differently—and how might that be beneficial?" Whenever you estimate that your honest answers should be "Nothing important" and "It won't," be cautious about ingesting it at all. I promise, you do not actually need to know everything all the time.  
在考虑是否以及多久获取新的或更新的信息来源时，请始终尝试问自己：“这可能会让我想要看到、思考或采取不同的做法，这会带来什么好处？”每当你估计你的诚实答案应该是“没什么重要的”和“不会”时，请务必谨慎对待它。我保证，你实际上并不需要一直知道一切。
* One easy and quick free writing exercise is to pick a word you just heard that tickles your brain. For three minutes and without pausing, write as many associations as you can think of with that word. Weirdly, something will grab you and stimulate your juices, and you may find yourself writing for longer than three minutes.  
一种简单快速的免费写作练习是选择一个你刚刚听到的让你大脑发痒的单词。用三分钟的时间，不间断地写下你能想到的与该词的尽可能多的联想。奇怪的是，有些东西会抓住你并刺激你的活力，你可能会发现自己写了超过三分钟。
* Related: try to avoid saying that you're going to "make yourself" do something. Instead, take a breath, and describe what you hope to _find yourself_ doing. Inhabit your intentionality, and quit trying to knock down a fully unlocked door.  
相关：尽量避免说你要“让自己”做某事。相反，深吸一口气，描述一下你希望自己做什么。保持你的意图，不要试图撞倒一扇完全没有锁的门。
* Relatedly related: a _goal_ can be a fine thing that describes a desired outcome defined by a positive change that you desire. On the other hand, think of an _intentionality_ as the mindful way you'll choose to conduct and focus yourself on the way to a "goal." Or pretty much anything else for that matter.  
相关的：目标可以是一件好事，它描述了由您想要的积极改变定义的期望结果。另一方面，将意向性视为您选择进行行为并专注于实现“目标”的正念方式。或者几乎任何其他与此相关的事情。
* Before telling someone else "how they are" or "what they should do," ask yourself how much those very important notes may actually be all about _your_ shit and absolutely zero about theirs.  
在告诉别人“他们怎么样”或“他们应该做什么”之前，问问自己，这些非常重要的笔记实际上可能全是关于你的事情，而关于他们的事情绝对为零。
* Give each of your houseplants a funny name. Then, _use_ it. If you have one plant and have no ideas, you may choose to call your friend, "Planty." That's what I do.  
给你的每一种室内植物起一个有趣的名字。然后，使用它。如果你只有一株植物但没有想法，你可以选择称呼你的朋友为“Planty”。我就是做这个的。

* Sometimes, when you're about to ask someone for help, you have a hunch that it might be something you could probably figure out on your own. To test your hunch, _draft_ (but do not send) your question as the smartest and most succinct message you can manage. Yes, reading it back to yourself may end up solving your actual problem. But, it nearly always helps to clarify whether it's something you actually _could_ figure out on your own.  
有时，当您要向某人寻求帮助时，您有一种预感，这可能是您自己可以解决的问题。为了测试您的预感，请将您的问题起草（但不要发送）为您可以管理的最明智、最简洁的消息。是的，自己读一遍可能最终会解决您的实际问题。但是，它几乎总是有助于澄清这是否是您实际上可以自己解决的问题。
* Related: knowing whether a problem is something you might be able to figure out on your own is arguably as important as actually "solving" the problem. Just ask anyone who's ever assumed they knew how to fix their own brakes or diagnose a weird lump.  
相关：知道问题是否是您可以自己解决的问题可以说与实际“解决”问题一样重要。只要问问那些自以为知道如何修理自己的刹车或诊断奇怪肿块的人就知道了。
* If you cannot understand why someone was traumatized by an event, maybe ask yourself who that says more about.  
如果你无法理解为什么某人会因某件事而受到创伤，也许问问自己这更多的是关于谁的。
* The second step in almost any project will involve the mindful introduction of _infrastructure_. I don't even need to know what your first step is; I can almost guarantee that there will be no third or fourth step if you aren't canny about getting the proper initial scaffolding in place.  
几乎所有项目的第二步都涉及精心引入基础设施。我什至不需要知道你的第一步是什么；我几乎可以保证，如果您不精明地安装适当的初始脚手架，则不会有第三步或第四步。
* Related: a lack of infrastructure is also why nearly all New Year's resolutions fail. Human will is a lot like a new locomotive; it's basically useless without the rails, controls, and signals that make the right thing the easy thing.  
相关：缺乏基础设施也是几乎所有新年决心都失败的原因。人类的意志很像一个新的火车头；如果没有使正确的事情变得容易的轨道、控制装置和信号，它基本上毫无用处。
* Always act as though you're going to survive. If you don't survive, it probably won't matter how you acted. And, if you do survive (which you probably will), I'll bet it's at least partly because you _acted_ like you were going to survive. Try it.  
永远表现得好像你会活下去一样。如果你没能活下来，你的行为可能并不重要。而且，如果你确实活了下来（你很可能会活下来），我敢打赌这至少部分是因为你表现得好像你会活下来。尝试一下。
* "Creative work" and "independent work" are rarely the same thing. In practice, a great deal of creative work is contracted or controlled by other people, and a striking amount of independent work is just shockingly non-creative. This is not a bad thing, but knowing about it in advance can save you a ton of unnecessary disappointment.  
“创造性工作”和“独立工作”很少是同一回事。在实践中，大量的创造性工作是由其他人承包或控制的，而大量的独立工作却令人震惊地缺乏创造性。这并不是一件坏事，但提前了解这一点可以让你避免很多不必要的失望。
* Unless you _really_ know what you’re doing, never give anyone underwear as a gift.  
除非您真的知道自己在做什么，否则切勿将内衣作为礼物送给任何人。

---

* Kids are unintentionally curious. What happens when I flush this rug? Would my cat enjoy wearing a fancy dress? Could this LEGO head also be a cool hat? Without regard to topic, try not to lose what’s left of your unintentional curiosity.  
孩子们无意识地好奇。当我冲洗这张地毯时会发生什么？我的猫喜欢穿奇装异服吗？这个乐高头也可以是一顶很酷的帽子吗？不管主题如何，尽量不要失去你无意中剩下的好奇心。
* Some people like to tell you what to pay attention to. Many want to determine how you should feel about it. Others specialize in advising exactly what you should do as a result. Just be aware that these are each different things, and it's probably wise to avoid people who are adamant about demanding to control all three.  
有些人喜欢告诉你要注意什么。许多人想确定您对此有何感受。其他人则专门建议您最终应该做什么。请注意，这些都是不同的事情，明智的做法是避免那些坚决要求控制这三者的人。
* Related: being good at one of these things rarely means someone's also great at the others.  
相关：擅长其中一件事很少意味着某人也擅长其他事情。
* Unrelated: this also goes for the notional expertise portfolio of billionaires. Sometimes, perversely so.  
无关：这也适用于亿万富翁的名义专业知识组合。有时，反常的是这样。
* In the world of independently making stuff, success with an audience can be thought of as a slice of cake that is impossibly slim but improbably deep. Stay focused on delighting the right tiny wedge of the best baked good you can make and there's potentially no limit to how tall it can get.  
在独立制作的世界里，获得观众的成功可以被认为是一块蛋糕，它薄得令人难以置信，但深度却令人难以置信。专注于让您能制作的最好的烘焙食品中的正确小楔子感到高兴，并且它可以长到多高。
* Related: please do not eat your fans. They are not actually cake.  
相关：请不要吃你的粉丝。它们实际上不是蛋糕。
* Great cities often thrive on the number of options that ordinary people have for getting from Point A to Point B—and for potentially exploring unfamiliar terrain both between and beyond those points. Limit those options to less than a handful, and both your city and its points start to lose a lot of their appeal. (Even if you have a _really_ nice car.)  
大城市的繁荣往往取决于普通人从 A 点到 B 点的多种选择，以及探索这些点之间和之外的陌生地形的可能性。将这些选项限制在少数几个范围内，您的城市及其点都会开始失去很多吸引力。 （即使你有一辆非常好的车。）
* Treat recipes like a journey, not a destination. Once you feel like you're mostly nailing the basic instructions, start looking for ways to make it your own. Remember, you are probably not being scored.  
将食谱视为一次旅程，而不是目的地。一旦您觉得自己基本上掌握了基本说明，就可以开始寻找将其变成您自己的说明的方法。请记住，您可能不会被评分。
* Imagine standing on a footbridge and looking down as a fast, choppy stream rushes beneath you. Keep watching the stream—but try not to jump in the water. _There_. You just meditated a little.  
想象一下，站在人行桥上，向下看，一条湍急的溪流从你脚下奔流而过。继续观察溪流，但尽量不要跳入水中。那里。你只是稍微冥想了一下。
* Related: if it's useful, you might want to think about meditation as regular office hours with yourself.  
相关：如果它有用，您可能想将冥想视为自己的常规办公时间。
* When you're in your 20s, be advisable about accumulating a lot of long-term obligations. If, when, or as your options start to diminish, the sunk costs of theoretical security often become a costly millstone.  
当你二十多岁的时候，建议你承担很多长期的义务。如果、当或当你的选择开始减少时，理论上的安全性的沉没成本往往会成为代价高昂的磨石。
* First, make a hole. Because before you can properly clean, organize, or even _purge_ a given area, you'll need to know where the stuff that's not currently where you want it to be will go. Yes, especially the trash.  
首先，打一个洞。因为在您能够正确地清洁、组织甚至清除给定区域之前，您需要知道当前不在您想要的位置的东西将去往何处。是的，尤其是垃圾。
* If someone else is doing your dishes, be guarded in how often and loudly your criticize how they do it.  
如果别人为你洗碗，批评他们洗碗的频率和声音要谨慎。
* Related: This also goes for almost everything else.  
相关：这也适用于几乎所有其他事情。
* You may not always get to choose what makes you emotional, but you have more agency than you might think about what makes you _irrational_. Which is really kind of the point when you think about it. Which you should.  
你可能并不总能选择让你情绪化的因素，但你拥有比你想象的更多的能动性，去思考让你变得非理性的因素。当你思考这个问题时，这确实是一个重点。你应该这样做。
* Some people are skeptical about the teaching of any topic or thing that they don't personally already know and understand—or more often, something that they _think_ they know and understand.  
有些人对他们个人不知道和理解的任何主题或事物的教学持怀疑态度，或者更常见的是，他们认为自己知道和理解的东西。
* Related: You can draw your own conclusions as to what this reveals about those folks' intellectual curiosity. But do understand: the less they know, the less they think _you_ should know.  
相关：你可以得出自己的结论，看看这揭示了这些人的求知欲。但一定要明白：他们知道的越少，他们认为你应该知道的就越少。

* Find moments of grace where you can feel gratitude for the gift of having a small place in a world that is much bigger, older, and more interesting than you are.  
找到一些优雅的时刻，让你对在这个比你更大、更古老、更有趣的世界中占有一席之地的恩赐感到感激。
* Related: one excellent opportunity to practice this is every time you smile and raise your glass to join a toast.  
相关：练习这一点的一个绝佳机会是每次你微笑并举起酒杯祝酒时。
* There are Finish-the-Can people and Not-Finish-the-Can people. You know in your heart which kind you are. As do the people with whom you live.  
有“完成罐头”的人和“未完成罐头”的人。你心里清楚你是哪一类。和你住在一起的人也是如此。
* If you think about someone when they're not around and you find yourself wondering whether there are ways you could make their life a little better, consider that you might love them.  
如果你在某人不在身边时想起他们，并且想知道是否有办法可以让他们的生活变得更好一点，那么考虑一下你可能爱他们。
* Hats are like PowerPoint decks. Probably best to just steer clear until you understand why most men are terrible at it.  
帽子就像 PowerPoint 幻灯片。也许最好还是避开，直到你明白为什么大多数男人不擅长这样做。
* It can be frustrating when someone won't pay attention to the thing you wish they'd be paying more attention to. Consider that other people may sometimes feel that same frustration about you.  
当有人不关注你希望他们更多关注的事情时，你可能会感到沮丧。考虑一下其他人有时可能会对你感到同样的沮丧。
* Don't say you've lost something if you've merely _mislaid_ it. "Lost" is a really special word, best reserved for describing a precious thing you've accepted you'll never see again.  
如果你只是把某样东西放错地方了，不要说你丢失了它。 “迷失”是一个非常特别的词，最适合用来描述你已经接受但再也见不到的珍贵事物。
* Related: if you _have_ mislaid something, it's probably either underneath or inside of something else.  
相关：如果您丢失了某些东西，它可能位于其他东西的下面或内部。
* Relatedly related: remember to hunt for mislaid items in places where they aren't supposed to be. If a thing was where it's _supposed_ to be, then you wouldn't still be looking for it, would you?  
相关相关：记住在不应该放的地方寻找丢失的物品。如果一件事在它应该在的地方，那么你就不会还在寻找它，不是吗？
* If I were to pitch somebody on my favorite bit I’ve picked up from mindfulness, I’d suggest starting to frequently notice how you feel about how you feel.  
如果我要向某人推销我从正念中学到的最喜欢的一点，我建议开始经常注意你对自己的感受的感受。
* Related: if you don't think you sometimes have _big_ feelings about how you feel, please permit me to gently recommend your looking into mindfulness.  
相关：如果你不认为你有时对自己的感受有很大的感受，请允许我温和地建议你研究正念。
* Get a thin, lightweight rain jacket. Roll it up into a tight and tiny little burrito, secure it with a couple silicon/rubber bands, and just leave it in your backpack. Because no matter how much it's not raining right now, chances are it will rain again someday.  
准备一件轻薄的雨衣。将其卷成一个又紧又小的墨西哥卷饼，用几根硅胶/橡皮筋将其固定，然后将其放在背包中。因为无论现在没有下雨，总有一天会再次下雨。
* Unrelated: responsible project management is the art of calmly preparing for things that aren't happening right now. A manic dash to survive something that's already happening (and which you probably should have anticipated) is not generally regarded as a skillful application of the art.  
无关：负责任的项目管理是冷静地为现在没有发生的事情做准备的艺术。为了在已经发生的事情（你可能应该预料到的）中生存而疯狂地冲刺通常不被认为是艺术的熟练应用。
* Relatedly unrelated: the use of a rain umbrella should require roughly the same formal testing and certification as an automobile license. If you are in public and using an umbrella irresponsibly, you should lose your privileges. It is not your personal weather sword, and it makes you just _so_ much broader and pointier than you realize. Maybe just get a rain jacket.  
相关不相关：使用雨伞应该需要与汽车执照大致相同的正式测试和认证。如果你在公共场合不负责任地使用雨伞，你应该失去你的特权。它不是你个人的天气之剑，它让你比你意识到的更广泛和更尖锐。也许只要买一件雨衣就可以了。
* If you can't be a good example, at least try to become an interesting cautionary tale.  
如果你不能成为一个好榜样，至少尝试成为一个有趣的警示故事。

---

* When you need to scoop some ice out of a thing, never use something that could break—especially anything made of glass. Watching someone drunkenly plow a highball glass into an ice bin makes the retired busboy in me wildly uncomfortable.  
当您需要从某物中舀出一些冰块时，切勿使用可能破裂的东西，尤其是玻璃制成的东西。看着有人醉醺醺地把高球杯扔进冰柜里，让我这个退休的服务员感到非常不舒服。
* Occasionally silently remind yourself, "Remember you said you wanted this."  
偶尔默默地提醒自己，“记住你说过你想要这个。”
* Avoid telling people they're being scared wrong. Demanding that someone become more or less terrified about something is a dick move, and it usually says more about your hangups than their judgement.  
避免告诉人们他们被吓坏了。要求某人对某件事或多或少感到恐惧是一个愚蠢的举动，这通常更多地说明了你的困扰而不是他们的判断。
* Related: start noticing the people in your world who try to motivate you with fear. It's often because they don't have anything more appealing to offer. And, they know it.  
相关：开始注意你的世界中那些试图用恐惧激励你的人。这通常是因为他们没有提供更有吸引力的东西。而且，他们知道这一点。
* Relatedly related: whenever you can manage it, don't internalize fear until you've exhausted curiosity.  
相关的：只要你能控制住恐惧，就不要将恐惧内在化，直到你耗尽了好奇心。
* Anxiety has a way of encouraging you to obsess about a horrible thing your brain just made up. Next time this happens, try to relax and instead just gently acknowledge that sometimes your brain makes up horrible things. Believing these things and obsessing about them is ultimately optional.  
焦虑会鼓励你沉迷于你大脑刚刚编造的可怕事物。下次发生这种情况时，尝试放松，只是温和地承认有时你的大脑会编造出可怕的事情。相信这些事情并沉迷于它们最终是可选的。
* You'll almost always eventually regret having named something you made with a pun.  
你几乎总是最终会后悔用双关语命名你所做的东西。
* Lessons come where you find them. Not necessarily where you looked for them.  
教训就在你发现的地方。不一定是您在哪里寻找它们。
* Try to become someone who's fun to teach things to.  
努力成为一个乐于教书的人。

---

* Sometimes, your brain decides it’s time to play tennis. So, it starts serving ideas and images at you, each of which seems to require immediate, urgent, and committed volleys in return. Just remember: _it’s your damned head_, and it’s fine if you just want to go sit in the bleachers and watch your brain fire heaters at no one until it tires itself out.  
有时，你的大脑会决定是时候打网球了。因此，它开始向你提供想法和图像，每一个似乎都需要立即、紧急和坚定的截击作为回报。只要记住：这是你该死的头，如果你只是想坐在看台上，看着你的大脑在没有人的情况下燃烧，直到它自己累坏了，那也没关系。
* Whenever you notice something, consider saying "_thank you_" in your head. Even or especially if it's something small or random. You're saying thank you to the world for still being there—and thank you to yourself for noticing it.  
每当您注意到某件事时，请考虑在心里说“谢谢”。即使或特别是当它是小或随机的东西时。你要感谢这个世界仍然存在，也感谢你自己注意到了它。
* Related: if this strikes you as corny or emotionally disordered, then you, my friend, are not noticing enough things. Which also means you're definitely not saying "thank you" enough. So, honestly, who's the real weirdo here?  
相关：如果这让你觉得老套或情绪紊乱，那么你，我的朋友，没有注意到足够的事情。这也意味着你肯定说“谢谢”还不够。那么，说实话，谁才是真正的怪人呢？
* Relatedly related: _Thank you_.  
相关相关： 谢谢。
* Never tell someone they look like someone else. If you're in doubt, recall five times you've done this, it was welcomed, and it all turned out great for everyone. You either sound like a sociopath, a person who puts in women in wells, or, likely, both.  
永远不要告诉别人他们看起来像别人。如果您有疑问，请回想一下您已经这样做过五次，它受到了欢迎，而且结果对每个人都很好。你要么听起来像一个反社会者，一个把女人扔进井里的人，要么，很可能两者兼而有之。
* All photos are pictures, but not all pictures are photos. If you're talking about a photograph, and you call it a "picture," you sound a little like someone who drinks from a jug.  
所有照片都是照片，但并非所有照片都是照片。如果你谈论一张照片，并称其为“图片”，那么你听起来有点像一个用壶喝水的人。
* Sometimes, the problem is not that someone lacked the technology to make what they wanted. Often, they had more than enough technology to make what they wanted, but—yikes—just look at…_what they wanted_. (Thanks, Phantom Editor)  
有时，问题并不在于某人缺乏制造他们想要的东西的技术。通常，他们拥有足够的技术来制造他们想要的东西，但是——哎呀——看看……他们想要什么。 （谢谢幻影编辑）
* At least consider the option of not having an opinion.  
至少考虑一下不发表意见的选择。
* Every time you're tempted to harass your kid about "screen time," mentally imagine that you're actually ranting about, say, "_rectangle time_." Because it makes about as much sense right now. This is not the 12th century, you're not a particularly sagacious elder, and your kid probably doesn't benefit overmuch from adopting your rustic folklore about how concerning machines are.  
每当你想就“屏幕时间”骚扰你的孩子时，请在心里想象一下你实际上是在抱怨“矩形时间”。因为它现在同样有意义。现在不是 12 世纪，您不是一位特别睿智的长者，您的孩子可能不会从接受您有关机器如何令人担忧的乡村民间传说中受益匪浅。
* It's okay to plan a meal around dessert. You're an adult, and people who try to tell you how to eat should be offered dietary advice regarding eating a butt.  
围绕甜点来计划一顿饭是可以的。你是成年人了，那些试图告诉你如何吃东西的人应该得到关于吃屁股的饮食建议。
